# Getting Started

The Erlang LS language server works with all text editors and IDEs
which adhere to the _LSP_ protocol. The list of supported editors
include _Emacs_, _Vim_, _VS Code_, _Sublime Text 3_ and more.

These pages contain all the information needed to configure your
favourite text editor or IDE to use Erlang LS. You will also find
instructions on how to configure the server to recognize the structure
of your projects and to troubleshoot your installation when things do
not work as expected.
