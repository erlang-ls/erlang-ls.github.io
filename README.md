# erlang-ls.github.io

This repository contains the source code for the Erlang LS website at:

https://erlang-ls.github.io/

The website is powered by [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), a static
site generator.

Documentation is in _markdown_ format. The default branch is
configured to be `mkdocs`. That's the branch towards which you are
supposed to Pull Request changes. The `master` branch contains the
static website which gets automatically deployed to _GitHub pages_
whenever a Pull Request is merged to the `mkdocs` branch.

To try the changes locally, simply: `mkdocs serve`

- Note: you might have to [install Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/)
